# InvoiceApp — Release Notes

---

## Sprint 8 — Quick Wins & Bug Fixes (April 2026)

### Bug Fixes
- **BUG 1:** `get_invoices()` now accepts an optional `project_id` filter parameter (previously caused an error when called from the Time Tracking page).
- **BUG 2:** Write-off allocation preview no longer references an unset session state key; proportions are shown correctly without a broken amount preview.

### Improvements
- **SP 1:** Sidebar is now expanded by default on load — all pages are visible without needing to click.
- **SP 2:** Login form inputs now carry `autocomplete` attributes so browsers can offer saved credentials.
- **SP 3b:** Generate Invoice page now shows a caption clarifying that clicking the button saves the file to the `exports/` folder permanently; the Download button is optional.
- **SP 4b:** Invoice Log now displays a header row (Date | Invoice # | Client | Project | Net € | VAT € | Expenses € | File).
- **SP 4c:** Invoice Log now includes an **Expenses €** column.
- **SP 4d:** Invoice Log now shows a caption explaining that the PDF/DOCX button downloads from the local disk and may be unavailable if the file was moved.

## Sprint 7 — Project Codes, Time Tracking & Write-offs (April 2026)

### New Features
- **Page 5 — Project Codes:** Manage billing codes (`client_code` + `client_suffix`) per project. Per-code metrics: budget, billable charges, write-offs, remaining.
- **Page 6 — Time Tracking:** Import monthly time-charge CSV reports. View entries by batch, filter, and delete. Rollup tab shows project and per-code summaries.
- **Page 7 — Write-offs:** Record project-level (pro-rata) or ad-hoc write-offs. Log with reversal support.
- **Billing summary** added to each project card on Clients & Projects page (billable charges, invoiced, write-offs, remaining).

### Infrastructure
- `project_codes`, `time_entries`, and `write_offs` tables added to DB schema.
- `backend/db.py` extended with full CRUD for new tables, bulk import, and rollup queries.
- `shared/models.py` extended with `ProjectCode`, `TimeEntry`, and `WriteOff` dataclasses.
- `scripts/seed_from_csv.py`: one-time import of clients, projects, and project codes from NocoDb CSV exports.
- 19 new tests (29 total passing).

### PDF Fix
- Replaced ConvertAPI (cloud, requires network) with **docx2pdf** (local, drives Microsoft Word) + **LibreOffice headless** fallback. No network calls required.
